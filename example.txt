[Part] Galosity Example Tutorial
[Character] ZZ
ZZ: Hi! I'm ZZ.
[Character] Ichiku
Ichiku: Hi, I'm Ichiku nya~
ZZ: Welcome to Galosity, a lite pure-text galgame editor. Hope you enjoy this journey.
ZZ: Here you can press Enter to the next sentence, and Backspace to the previous.

--Basic Editing Functions--
ZZ: There are several shortcuts that you'll need to know.
ZZ: Ctrl+S to save, and Ctrl+Shift+S to save as file.
Ichiku: By default, your file will be automatically saved every 5 minutes.
ZZ: Ctrl+O to open file, and Ctrl+N to create new file.
Ichiku: Press F5 to see how your script look like.

--Character & Speeches--
ZZ: Define a character with tag `[Character]`.
Ichiku: Try: input `[ch` on a new line and press Tab. Galosity contains many Tab completions to improve productivity.
ZZ: Now input `[Character] ZZ`. This tells the system that there will be a character named ZZ.
Ichiku: Try: input `z` on a new line and press Tab.
Ichiku: Then input `ZZ: Hello Galosity!` and see how it is presented.

--Parts & Notes--
[Part] Notice this!
ZZ: It is recommended to organize long document with parts.
Ichiku: Have you noticed that the part has changed? Look at the top-left text.
[Part] You can also enter something like chapter name here...
Ichiku: Try: input `[Part] Chapter 0721`.

[Part] Notes
ZZ: Let's move on to notes.
ZZ: Notes are designed to show info which cannot be easily shown with pure text...
ZZ: This is to keep script-writers concentrated on scripts, instead of being disturbed by scenes, music, etc.
[Note] Yes pretend this is a beautiful photo of Ichiku
Ichiku: Try: input `[Note] sample note`.

[Part] Note? Comment?
ZZ: There is another similar function: input `//` at the start of a new line to create comments. The difference is that comments will be completely ignored by the system.
// Therefore you cannot see this comment nya~
Ichiku: Try: input some text on a new line and press Ctrl+/.

--Jumps & Anchors--
[Part] Goto Statement Considered Helpful
ZZ: These 2 functions are designed to make script structure clearer.
Ichiku: Try: input `[Anchor] anchor`...
Ichiku: Then input `[Jump] a` and press Tab.
ZZ: You might be familiar with these if you have written some low-level programming languages...
Ichiku: Anyway. Let's [Jump] onto the next part.
[Jump] Control Blocks
Ichiku: ...And of course you won't see this sentence nya~
ZZ: But notice that [Part] tags still work, just like this:

[Part] Under Control
[Anchor] Control Blocks
ZZ: Of course, an important part of galgame is selection.
ZZ: If you've ever used something like switch-case statements while programming, you will feel this very natural.
Ichiku: Try: first input a sentence, then input `[Select]` on a new line.
Ichiku: Then input `[Case] 1:`, `case1`, `[Case] 2:`, `case2`, `[End]` on the following lines.
ZZ: As you see, there will be 2 selection buttons which leads you to different branches.
ZZ: In order not to pass through the following cases, input `[Break]` at the end of a branch.
Ichiku: Have you learnt how to use control blocks now?
[Select]
[Case] Yes:
[Jump] End of Tutorial
[Case] No:
ZZ: Fine... Let's learn again.
[Jump] Control Blocks
[End]
